# Project Euler Solutions 

These are fun math + optimization problems. I dont want to do all of them just some fun challenging brute force problems. These are more fun than Advent of Code. 

## Setup

To start a problem, identify the problem number on projecteuler.net and run the following command to download the text to markdown and initalize a go module.
```sh
$ setup.sh <number>
```

## Eval
The scripts will be evaluated as an actions workflow in [eval.yml](./.github/workflows/eval.yml) or using [eval.sh](./eval.sh)
